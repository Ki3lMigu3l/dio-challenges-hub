This repository documents a cost optimization study developed for a
pharmaceutical operations scenario, focusing on the strategic adoption
of Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Overview

Pharmaceutical companies rely heavily on technology to support:

- Inventory management  
- Sales systems  
- Regulatory documentation  
- Data storage and retention  
- Operational reporting  

Traditional infrastructure models often lead to:

- Overprovisioned servers  
- Fixed operational costs  
- Low resource utilization  
- Inefficient storage allocation  

This challenge evaluates how AWS services can be applied to reduce
operational expenses while maintaining performance, scalability,
and security.


## Objective

Identify and describe **three AWS services** capable of delivering:

- Immediate cost reduction  
- Improved operational efficiency  
- Scalability aligned with business demand  


## Evaluated AWS Services

- **Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling**  
- **Amazon S3 with Lifecycle Policies**  
- **AWS Lambda (Serverless Computing)**  


## Deliverables

- [Technical Report](./technical_report.md)


## Context

This study was developed as part of a cloud computing challenge
within a technology training program.
